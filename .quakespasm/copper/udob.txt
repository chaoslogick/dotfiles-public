    Play Information
    ----------------
A 7+2 level episode for Copper Quake. Designed for single player and cooperative.
All maps are playable as a contiguous episode, but supplies are provided to ensure
they are all completable from a shotgun start as well.

    "Trapped in the Past" (start) - Lunaran (because aren't we all?)
    "Space Jam" (udob1) - Lunaran
    "A Drowning" (udob2) - Lunaran
    "Pit of the Living Dead" (udob3) - Lunaran
    "A Saint Nobody Has Heard Of" (udob4) - Lunaran
    "Last Waltz" (udob5) - Scampie
    "How Deep Is Your Lava" (udob6) - Lunaran   
    "House of Pain" (udob7) - Scampie   
    "Mothers Be Good To Your Spawns" (end) - Lunaran

Autosaves are supported in single player - type 'load auto' at the console to load 
the last autosave.

Rather than treat the Easy/Normal/Hard/Nightmare curve as a measure of combat 
intensity, as is common for Quake, we instead consciously envisioned difficulty 
level as a measure of survivability. We made the choice everywhere possible to
scale the resources and situational benefits given to players as much as we added
or removed monsters, to ensure that Easy doesn't mean boring and that Hard 
doesn't mean endless hordes (usually :)). Underdark Overbright takes full advantage 
of the higher skill ceiling provided by Copper, and is designed to be fair but 
challenging. However, if it feels like you selected the wrong value of fair in the
start map, changing the 'skill' cvar at the console at any time will take effect
upon starting the next map, and you should feel free to do so without fear that 
you may be "missing" something by not sticking with your usual skill setting.
(The intermission screen is a good place to remember this.)

    
    Requirements
    ------------
UDOB requires a registered copy of Quake, and for Copper to be installed. Copper can 
be downloaded from [ http://www.lunaran.com/copper/ ]. 

A few of UDOB's maps require an engine with support for increased limits (efrags, 
static entities, etc) and alpha cutout textures. Fitzquake-derived engines such as 
Quakespasm or MarkV are recommended, and should work with zero fiddling by the user. 

DarkPlaces is not supported. DarkPlaces is stupidly broken. DarkPlaces is cursed.


    Installation
    ------------
Unzip the contents of udob.zip into your /copper/ directory, preserving subfolders.

Start a new game from the menu or type 'map start' at the console, then do what comes 
naturally.
