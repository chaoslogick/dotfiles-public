DEDICATED SERVERS
	Important Note:  Add 4194304 to the X resulting from the
	formula below.  This is the flag that tells the mod to use
	TEMP1 for configuration.  For example, if the result from
	the formulas below is X = 128, then set temp1 to
	4194304 + 128 = 4194432.

	Dedicated servers (or anyone else) can configure their
	bot setup using the temp1 console variable.  Type TEMP1 X
	at the console, where X is determined by the following
	formula:
	
	For team play - 
		X = 	number bot-only team bots * 16
			+ number bots/player team * 256
			+ 4096 for restricted mode
			+ 8192 for super restricted mode
			+ 16384 to set bot team mode.
	
	For deathmatch play -
		X = 	number of bots * 16
			+ max bots + players restriction * 256
			+ 4096 for restricted mode
			+ 8192 for super restricted mode.

	Examples:
		- Non-team deathmatch with 8 bots, X = 128.
		- Team deathmatch with 3 bots per player team,
		no bot only team, X = 768.
		- Team deathmatch with 3 bots per player team,
		4 bot bot-only team, X = 772.
		- Non-team deathmatch with 8 bots + players
		maximum, X = 2048.
		- Non-team deathmatch with 8 bots + players
		maximum, super restricted, X = 10240.

	Important note: if setting the serverflags, never use a value
	larger than 15 in the equations above. Remember to add
	4194304 to the result from the formulas above.
