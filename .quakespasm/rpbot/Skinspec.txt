Player.mdls for use with Reaper bots
(see bottom of note for recommended design of skins)

   Description:  The skins are just different colored normal player textures.
	If you want to differentiate the bots, but like the normal quake guy
	skin, this is the player.mdl for you.

-------------------------------------------------------
While I don't plan to include skins with the bots, I am putting
together a file of "recommended" player.mdls for use with the
reaper bot.  This note describes how the bots will use the skins.
If you have put together a player.mdl for use with the reaprbot, send
me a note describing it and where it can be downloaded from, and
I'll include a mention of it in this file in future releases.

Reaper bot skin spec v0.8
(BTW, if you think this can be improved, I welcome suggestions)

The reaper bot assumes there are 16 skins in the player.mdl file
(numbered 0 to 15).  Skin 0 should be the default quake skin.
Skin 15 is what the "bot only" team uses if skins are enabled.  
If the "show difficulty" mode is enabled, then skins 1 to 4
will be associated with progressively higher skill levels (e.g. 
skill 0 = skin 1, etc.).  Otherwise, the bots will during deathmatch
play choose any skin between 0 and 15.  For teamplay, of course,
the bots will share the skin of their human teammate if they aren't
on the bot only team.
